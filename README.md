# BBC Article on Open-Source Development
[This article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7n2jm5m5o) Interests me mostly because open source development does, and I find open source projects essential to my everyday funcitoning - I'm writing this on an open-source text editor, in an open source operating system, running an opem-source window manager, with an open-source taskbar, and using open-source tools to communicate and engage with the internet and technology as a whole. As open source devs age, were having more and more issues of critical software being unmaintained - hell neofetch is unmaintained now - and I fear we are approaching a time when proprietary solutions win the day, and the values I love of free as in speech software will no longer be viable.
